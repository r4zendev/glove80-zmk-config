## Layout

Base layer is using Colemak-DH alphas with a slight change based on Manna Harbour's [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku), which is replacing `;` at top right pinky with `'`.
To use this as-is, one would need to install [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) or any other software to remap f13 and f14 keys. F13 is mapped to Apple globe key, F14 is a combination of CMD+SHIFT+OPT+CTRL.
